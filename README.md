### 🌟 **About Me**
If there's one thing my journey proves, it's that I **thrive on challenges**—whether it’s predicting market trends with AI, optimizing insurance operations, or cooking for hundreds under pressure (because sometimes, the best insights come from the kitchen!).  

I'm currently pursuing a **Master of Science in Business Analytics** at **Clark University**, where I apply **data science, machine learning, and predictive analytics** to solve complex business problems. My diverse background spans **insurance, finance, education, and AI-driven automation**, making me a versatile problem solver and an innovative thinker.

🔹 **Data Enthusiast | AI Practitioner | Business Strategist | Educator**  
🔹 **I love transforming data into actionable insights, building AI-driven solutions, and optimizing business decisions.**

### 🎭 **Beyond Data Science**  
When I’m not coding, analyzing business problems, or optimizing machine learning models, you’ll find me:

🎭 **Organizing marketing strategies** for cultural events like the **Hanover Theatre**  
📖 **Mentoring students** in **chemistry & data science**, with many excelling at top universities
